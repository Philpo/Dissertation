abstract = {This paper mainly introduces the improved classical spring-mass model, some satisfied spring parameters can be obtained with the data-driven strategy and computer assisted tomography technology, and if some external forces are added, we can get more realistic simulation results. Discussing the Euler algorithm, the midpoint algorithm, the Four-ord Runge-Kutta algorithm and adaptive Runge-Kutta algorithm, when they are under the same condition, it is found that each algorithm has its own characteristics, and the adaptive Runge-Kutta algorithm can make the cloth to achieve the system balance in a shorter time. This algorithm is accurate and effective, it is an ideal method to simulate flexible cloths, and it provides a new solution to realize the computer dynamic simulation of flexible cloths.},

@article{SantosSouza2014,
abstract = {—Cloth simulation has many applications areas like computer animation, computer games or virtual reality. The simulation of cloth tearing is often a non-trivial process because it requires the capacity of dynamically updating different cloth representations and data structures. For interactive animations, this must be performed as fast as possible. We present a comprehensive description of a technique that can be used to simulate cloth being torn or cut. Despite simplistic and not physically accurate, it is fast and can provide visually pleasing results. Also, it can be easily adapted to work with nearly any cloth model. As an original contribution, we introduce an optimization of this technique by using an especially adapted half-edge data structure. We have implemented the techniques described in this paper in a physics simulator that was specially developed for a garment CAD system. Our tests have shown fast and attractive results.},

abstract = {Though there is much research on physically-based animation of soft bodies, simulating soft body objects in real-time remains challenging problem. This paper presents an algorithm for simulating leaking effects in real-time soft body simulations where fast calculation is priority. To simulate leaking effects in a soft body, geometrical cases of broken springs are defined and an algorithm rearranges the topology of neighbors in which the broken springs are connected. Then, internal forces are applied to surface points to model the leaking effect and deform the soft body. Experiments show that the soft body objects with leaking effects can be realistically simulated at interactive speeds on common hardware.},

@inproceedings{Farias2008,
abstract = {Single processor technology has been evolving across last decades, but due to physical limitations of chip manufacturing process, the industry is pursuing alternatives to sustain computational power growth,including the creation of multi-core systems. Parallel computing targets problems that are scalable and possibly distributed, dividing the problem into smaller pieces. This approach may be explored to satisfy real-time constraints required by real time physics simulation. This work introduces an optimal solution to implement accurate simulation of deformable bodies in real time. This is accomplished through the use of a meshless simulation technique, known as Point Based Animation, implemented using a parallel framework:the NVIDIA Compute Unified Device Architecture(CUDA). Our implementation showed significative improvements on performance in comparison to the former CPU one: impressive speedups around 20times could be achieved in the simulation of deformable bodies with 575 physical elements (phyxels) and53,504 surface elements (surfels).},

abstract = {Soft bodies are the models in which the bodies deform during animated frames depending on the interaction between themselves and environment. This paper presents a parametric general model for soft body simulation in which structure, deformation, and volume controls generate animated deformations restricted by a set of constraints within or without an environment of gravitation. In this model, the soft body shape is controlled by structure control and anamorphosis of the soft body is created by deformation control, while the mass is approximated by volume control. A set of constraints for these controls further restrict the types of deformation of the soft body. By selecting specific methods for structure, deformation, and volume controls with a set of constraints, we demonstrate a variety of appealing fluid-like surfaces and respiration of lungs for validating the usefulness of the general model.},
