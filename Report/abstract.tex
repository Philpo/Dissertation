\chapter*{Abstract}

There are many models that have been proposed for cloth simulation but the majority at too computationally expensive to be used in real time. The Mass-Spring model is perhaps the only model that can be used for real time cloth simulations. This project investigates the performance of Mass-Spring model; in particular looking at the numerical integration methods that must be used to solve the differential equation inherent to the model.
\\The four most common explicit integrators, explicit Euler, Midpoint, fourth order Runge-Kutta and Verlet, were implemented for the Mass-Spring model. Data about the performance of each integrator was extracted using two simulation scenarios. The data showed that the choice of numerical integrator can have a great impact on the performance of the model and the results were different from what was expected. The expensive Midpoint and fourth order Runge-Kutta integrators could not use a sufficiently large time step to offset their high cost and so the cheap explicit Euler and Verlet integrators are recommended for real time simulations.
