\chapter*{Abstract}

There has been much research into teaching computers to play games effectively, resulting in programs which are capable of beating the best human players at chess and other board games. These programs typically make use of strongly defined rules to provide their intelligence. This project suggests a different technique; applying stochastic optimisation techniques to effectively learn the strategic rules for playing Connect 4.
\\Three popular algorithms, a genetic algorithm, evolution strategies and particle swarm optimisation, were implemented to play Connect 4 in The Arena, a Java based framework providing the implementation of the game. Following a training period to learn the rules of the game, the playing performance of these algorithms was tested. The test results showed limited success, with only one of the algorithms able to play relatively successfully. The time constraints for the development of this project may be the reason for the poor performance of the algorithms, therefore more research and testing should be considered.
