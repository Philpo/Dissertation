\chapter{Test Plan}

\section{Test Data}
To evaluate the hypotheses, a number of data fields will be captured from the simulation
\begin{itemize}
\item{Simulation frame rate. This will be affected by the cost and frequency of the integration calculations and is essential to capture to determine if the simulation is running in real time}
\item{Average time spent in the various functions such as calcSpringForce and update. Extracting these timing will give a better understanding of where the time each frame is spent}
\item{Update Count. By comparing this with the average update time it will be possible to evaluate the effectiveness of higher cost integrators}
\end{itemize}
The data mentioned above will be extracted by simulating the cloth in two different scenarios.
\\The first, or sheet, scenario will simulate a sheet hanging from a washing line. The top left and right particles of the cloth will be pinned, so as to be unaffected by any forces, and gravity applied as the sole external force.
\\The second scenario will simulate a flag on a flag pole flapping in the wind. Particles on the left edge of the cloth will be pinned with gravity and a wind force acting as external forces. The addition of wind will result in much more movement in the cloth so this scenario provides data on performance of a more active simulation.

\section{Test Parameters}
Mass-Spring models for cloth simulation have a number of different parameters which affect realism and performance, and are notoriously difficult to tune.

\subsection{Mesh Size}
This is the discretisation of the cloth, i.e. the number of particles used to represent the cloth, and is represented by two integers representing the number of rows and columns; the total number of particles in the cloth is therefore $rows \times columns$.
\\Increasing mesh size will result in a more realistic simulation but there will be direct impacts on performance as a result. Adding more particles adds more springs, and therefore more calculations are needed every time step to calculate the internal forces. Adding more particles also increases the number of integration calculations needed every time step and both of these factors combined will result in a performance hit for the simulation.
\\Several different mesh sizes will be used when evaluating the project hypotheses. Data will be extracted for each integrator at each mesh size. This will allow a comparison of the performance impact of the integrators when mesh size is varied.

\subsection{Integrator Time Step}
The time step will vary from integrator to integrator and must be set carefully in order to maintain the stability of the cloth.
\\Varying the time step will affect the performance of the simulation as it will vary the frequency with which the integration calculations must be performed.
\\The maximum stable time step will be used along with a number of smaller time steps. This will allow a direct comparison of performance impact as time step decreases; the maximum time step value will be found by investigating the point at which the integrators become unstable.

\subsection{Spring and Damping Coefficients}
Varying the spring and damping coefficients of the springs will affect the realism of the simulation. If the stiffness is set too low, then the particle displacement will increase and may result in unrealistic deformations of the cloth. On the other hand, if the stiffness is set too high then this can lead to no displacement in the cloth at all. For damping, if it is set too low then the cloth will oscillate too much and appear too elastic, if set too high then the cloth will appear as if moving through a viscous fluid, such as oil.
\\Varying stiffness may also have an impact on the simulation's performance; increasing the stiffness may require the use of smaller time steps in order to maintain stability, depending on the chosen integrator.

\subsection{Particle Mass}
Since this project is not concerned with truly accurate cloth modelling, the particles' mass will be defined uniformly; that is, a total mass will be defined for the cloth and then divided by the number or particles to give the mass of an individual particle.
\\Varying the mass of the particles may have an impact on simulation performance. As a result of Equation \ref{eq:gravity}, increasing the mass of a particle will increase its displacement due to gravity and therefore, the stiffness of the springs may need to be increased in order to maintain the realism of the simulation. 
\\\\Since this project is primarily concerned with measuring the performance of different integrators, mesh size and time step are the key parameters. As such, mass and spring and damping coefficients will be kept the same for each mesh size. In this way only one parameter will change between tests and therefore the true effect of the parameter on performance can be measured. The downside of keeping mass and the coefficients  constant is that it may not lead to the most realistic cloth, however this is acceptable because the focus is on measuring performance rather than appearance.

\section{Test Process}
As the previous section details, the first stage of the testing process will be investigations into suitable values for the various test parameters. Following this, the test data will be extracted for every combination of mesh size and time step, in both the flag and sheet scenarios.
\\This, second, testing phase will be automated, using an XML file to detail the specific integrator and test parameters to use. The XML file will take the following form:
\lstset{
    breaklines=true,
    postbreak=\raisebox{0ex}[0ex][0ex]{\ensuremath{\color{red}\hookrightarrow\space}},
    language=XML,
    upquote=true
}
\begin{lstlisting}
<test_list>
  <test id=''''>
    <integrator type=''''  time_step=''''/>
    <cloth_params height='''' width='''' mass='''' wind_constant=''''>
      <top_left_position x='''' y='''' z='''' />
      <mesh_size rows='''' columns='''' />
      <structural spring_coefficient='''' damping_coefficient='''' />
      <shear spring_coefficient='''' damping_coefficient='''' />
      <flexion spring_coefficient='''' damping_coefficient='''' />
      <wind direction x='''' y='''' z='''' />
    </cloth_params>
  </test>
</test_list>
\end{lstlisting}
Each test element extracted from the test\_list will be run in both the flag and sheet scenario.
\\Scenarios will be run for a maximum of one minute, and when the run is completed, the appropriate test data will be extracted and stored in a CSV file.
